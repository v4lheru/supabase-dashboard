# Active Context

## Current Task
✅ **COMPLETED**: Enhanced Project Analytics Dashboard with time-based filtering, historical views, and project health indicators.

## What I've Completed
1. **✅ Time-Based Default Filters**: 
   - On-going projects default to "this-month" filter
   - One-time projects default to "all-time" filter
   - Project health indicators use appropriate time periods

2. **✅ Project Health Integration**:
   - Sidebar health indicators driven by project-type-specific time periods
   - On-going projects: Health based on "this-month" performance
   - One-time projects: Health based on "all-time" performance

3. **✅ Removed "All Projects" Mixed View**:
   - Eliminated confusing mixed project type view
   - Focused on separate On-going and One-time project views
   - Updated sidebar to show only relevant project types

4. **✅ Enhanced Historical Views**:
   - **On-going Projects**: 6-month historical timeline showing monthly health status
   - **One-time Projects**: Project lifecycle view with completion stages
   - Real monthly data fetching with proper health calculations

5. **✅ Tabbed Dashboard Interface**:
   - "Dashboard" tab: Original overview with filtering and analytics
   - "Historical" tab: Project-type-specific historical analysis
   - Seamless switching between views

6. **✅ Monthly Data Services**:
   - Added `getClientTasksForMonth()` function for historical analysis
   - Proper month-by-month data calculation
   - Accurate profit margin and health status per month

## Database Schema Understanding
### clickup_supabase_main table:
- Contains live ClickUp task data with timestamps
- Fields: task_id, task_name, folder_name, status, time_spent, date_updated, assignees
- Used for both current analytics and historical month-by-month analysis

### client_mappings table:
- Contains client configuration and project setup
- Fields: client_name, project_type, available_hours, revenue, average_delivery_hourly, status
- Source of truth for project parameters and financial calculations

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Smart Time Filtering**: Automatic appropriate defaults based on project type
2. **Historical Analysis**: 6-month view for ongoing, lifecycle view for one-time
3. **Health Indicators**: Time-period-aware health calculations in sidebar
4. **Tabbed Interface**: Clean separation between dashboard and historical views
5. **Real Data Integration**: All views use actual Supabase data with proper time filtering

## Architecture
- **On-going Projects**: Monthly-focused analysis with historical trends
- **One-time Projects**: Lifecycle-focused analysis with completion tracking
- **Unified Data Layer**: Single data service supporting both time-based and lifecycle views
- **Responsive Design**: All views work across desktop and mobile

## Priority
✅ **COMPLETED** - All requested features implemented and tested
