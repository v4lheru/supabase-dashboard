# Progress Tracking

## Completed ✅
- **Memory Bank Setup**: Created all required documentation files
- **Project Analysis**: Understood existing UI structure and mock data
- **Database Schema Analysis**: Analyzed provided table structures
- **Requirements Gathering**: Clear understanding of Supabase integration needs

## Currently Working On 🔄
- **Supabase Integration**: Setting up database connection and client
- **Data Layer Implementation**: Creating services to fetch real data
- **UI Component Updates**: Replacing mock data with real Supabase data

## Next Steps 📋
1. **Install Supabase Dependencies**
   - Add @supabase/supabase-js to package.json
   - Set up environment variables

2. **Database Connection Setup**
   - Create Supabase client configuration
   - Test connection with provided credentials
   - Verify table access and permissions

3. **Data Services Implementation**
   - Create data fetching utilities for both tables
   - Implement data aggregation logic
   - Add TypeScript interfaces for data structures

4. **UI Component Updates**
   - Update project-sidebar.tsx to use real client data
   - Modify project-dashboard.tsx for real metrics
   - Update all-projects-overview.tsx for aggregated data

5. **Railway Deployment**
   - Create railway.json configuration
   - Set up environment variables for production
   - Test deployment process

## Technical Debt 🔧
- Remove all mock data once real data is integrated
- Add proper error handling for database operations
- Implement loading states for data fetching
- Add data validation and sanitization

## Testing Requirements 🧪
- Test database connections
- Verify data calculations are accurate
- Test UI with real data
- Validate Railway deployment

## Blockers/Risks ⚠️
- None currently identified
- Database permissions need verification
- Railway deployment configuration needs testing

## Success Criteria 🎯
- Dashboard displays real data from Supabase
- Client mappings are dynamically loaded
- Financial calculations are accurate
- Successfully deployed to Railway
- UI is responsive and functional with real data
